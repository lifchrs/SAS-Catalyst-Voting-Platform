## Motivation
This project was completed as a part of my catalyst project. I aimed to build a blockchain-enabled voting platform to seamlessly integrate community feedback into school policy decisions therefore make it possible to have more discourse regarding school policy.

## Project Description
The platform is built using Solidity to program smart contracts, Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum nodes, and Javascript to display the page. It is hosted on the Rinkeby Test Network, meaning that real Ether doesn't have to be used. Bootstrap is used as a CSS framework, Node JS is used for the front-end, and Truffle was used to help develop the smart contracts.
